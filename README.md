## Dataset

The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, though? Almost always greater than 10. 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc. Why? Because "they're good dogs Brent." WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage.


## Summary of Investigation


From the data, we can conclude the following:

1. Relationship between the number of retweets and number of favorites: From the scatter plot above, it is apparent that there is a linear relationship between dog posts that people favorite and those that they retweet
2. Relationship between retweets and dog stage: From the visualizations, we can see that dogs in the floofer stage have the most retweets while dogs in the pupper stage have the least number of retweets on average.
3. What percentages are higher for the various posts relative to dog stages?: From the pie chart we can see that there 69% of all tweeted dogs belong to the pupper stage, while only 1% belong to the Floofer stage. Therefore the largest stage represended is Pupper while the smallest stage respresented is Floofer
